In passing, albeit a little late in the day, if you add following two lines to your code in the relevant places:

import os
    os.system("start D:\udacity\ud036-python\circus2.wav")
then the windows media player will open and start playing the music.

I downloaded the music from https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entrance_of_the_Gladiators in ogg format and then downloaded VLC media player to convert it to .wav format.
